Welcome to the AI-Spec–Driven Book with Embedded RAG Chatbot. This educational resource provides comprehensive coverage of ROS 2 and Humanoid Robotics.

## About this Book

This book is designed for AI and robotics students with basic Python knowledge who are new to ROS 2 and humanoid robotics. The content is structured in modules that build upon each other:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Introduction to ROS 2 as the middleware "nervous system" for humanoid robots
- **Module 2**: Simulation and Control - Covering simulation and Gazebo
- **Module 3**: Perception and AI - Advanced perception and AI training topics

Each module is designed to be self-contained while building on previous concepts.

# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). This module introduces AI and robotics students to digital twin concepts for humanoid robots, using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of digital twins in Physical AI
- Understand how to simulate physics, gravity, collisions, and dynamics using Gazebo
- Integrate URDF models with Gazebo simulation and validate robot behavior
- Use Unity for creating high-fidelity environments with visual realism
- Synchronize Unity with ROS 2 and understand sim-to-real considerations
- Simulate sensors like LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- Publish simulated sensor data to ROS 2 for perception testing

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: Gazebo Physics Simulation** - Foundation of digital twin concepts with physics simulation
2. **Chapter 2: Unity Digital Environments** - High-fidelity visual environments and human-robot interaction
3. **Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation for Humanoid Robots** - Simulated sensors and perception pipelines

## Prerequisites

- Basic ROS 2 knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental programming concepts

## Next Steps

Start with [Chapter 1: Gazebo Physics Simulation](./chapter-1-gazebo-physics-simulation.md) to build your foundation in digital twin concepts.

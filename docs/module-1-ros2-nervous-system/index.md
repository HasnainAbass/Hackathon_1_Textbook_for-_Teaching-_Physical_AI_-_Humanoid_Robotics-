# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2). This module introduces AI and robotics students to ROS 2 as a middleware for humanoid robots, enabling communication, control, and embodiment through standardized interfaces.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand what ROS 2 is and why it is critical for Physical AI
- Explain the core ROS 2 architecture components: nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Describe DDS-based communication and real-time considerations
- Understand how ROS 2 enables modular, distributed robot systems
- Create Python agents that interface with ROS 2 using rclpy
- Understand how robots are represented digitally using URDF

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2 for Physical AI** - Foundational concepts of ROS 2 architecture
2. **Chapter 2: ROS 2 Control with Python Agents (rclpy)** - Practical implementation with Python
3. **Chapter 3: Robot Body Representation with URDF** - Digital representation of robot bodies

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental programming concepts

## Next Steps

Start with [Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2 for Physical AI](./chapter-1-ros2-foundations.md) to build your foundational knowledge.

# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3, where we explore advanced perception, navigation, and training for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac platforms. This module focuses on the AI components that enable humanoid robots to understand and navigate their environment effectively.

## Overview

This module covers three critical aspects of AI-powered humanoid robotics:

1. **NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data Generation** - Learn how simulation environments create synthetic data for training perception models
2. **Isaac ROS for Accelerated Perception** - Understand hardware-accelerated perception capabilities for efficient robot vision
3. **Navigation with Nav2 for Humanoids** - Explore how to adapt navigation systems for bipedal robots

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of Isaac Sim in Physical AI and synthetic data generation
- Describe Isaac ROS hardware-accelerated perception capabilities and performance benefits
- Understand Nav2 architecture and how to adapt it for humanoid navigation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Familiarity with ROS 2 concepts
- Understanding of digital twin concepts
- Basic knowledge of robotics perception and navigation

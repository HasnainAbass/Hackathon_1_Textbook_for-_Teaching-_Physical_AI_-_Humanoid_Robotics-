# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Humanoid Robotics

## Overview

Welcome to Module 4, where we explore the fascinating world of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for humanoid robotics. This module builds upon the foundations laid in previous modules to create sophisticated autonomous behaviors that combine speech, language models, perception, and control.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Implement voice-to-action interfaces that convert natural language commands into executable robot actions
2. Use large language models for cognitive planning and task decomposition
3. Integrate voice, planning, perception, and control in a complete VLA pipeline
4. Validate VLA systems in simulation environments

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Experience with ROS 2 (covered in Module 1)
- Understanding of simulation environments (covered in Module 2)
- Knowledge of AI-robot brain systems (covered in Module 3)

### Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

1. **Voice-to-Action Interfaces**: Learn how to process voice commands and translate them into ROS 2 actions
2. **LLM-Based Cognitive Planning**: Explore how large language models can decompose complex goals into action sequences
3. **Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid**: Integrate all components into a complete VLA pipeline

### Target Audience

This module is designed for AI and robotics students who are experienced with ROS 2, simulation, and navigation. The focus is on combining speech, language models, perception, and control to enable autonomous humanoid behavior.

### Simulation-First Approach

All examples and exercises in this module use simulation environments, making them accessible to students without physical hardware access. This approach allows for safe experimentation and validation of VLA concepts.

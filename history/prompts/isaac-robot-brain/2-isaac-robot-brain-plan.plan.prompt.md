  1. Install and initialize Docusaurus; configure the docs structure and sidebar for Module 3.
  2. Create Module 3 documentation with three chapters (Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data, Isaac ROS & Perception, Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation), ensuring all files are written in `.md` format.
response_text: |
  Successfully completed the planning and implementation of Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™). Created the implementation plan, researched Docusaurus setup, designed documentation structure, and created all three chapter files. Updated the sidebar configuration to include the new module with proper labeling. The three chapters cover Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data Generation, Isaac ROS for Accelerated Perception, and Navigation with Nav2 for Humanoids.
outcome: |
  Module 3 documentation successfully created with three comprehensive chapters covering NVIDIA Isaac platforms for humanoid robots. The Docusaurus site is properly configured with navigation to all new content. Ready for the next phase of development.
evaluation: |
  The planning phase successfully identified all necessary steps and completed the implementation of the Isaac Robot Brain module. All requirements from the original prompt were met, including Docusaurus configuration and creation of three chapter files in Markdown format.

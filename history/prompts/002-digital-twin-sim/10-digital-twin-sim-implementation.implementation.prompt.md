## Prompt

[No specific prompt provided - implementing based on tasks.md]

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) educational content. All 39 tasks across 6 phases have been completed:

- Phase 1: Setup (3/3 tasks completed) - Docusaurus project initialized with required configuration
- Phase 2: Foundational (4/4 tasks completed) - Core documentation infrastructure established
- Phase 3: User Story 1 (9/9 tasks completed) - Chapter 1 on Gazebo physics simulation created
- Phase 4: User Story 2 (8/8 tasks completed) - Chapter 2 on Unity digital environments created
- Phase 5: User Story 3 (7/7 tasks completed) - Chapter 3 on sensor simulation created
- Phase 6: Polish (8/8 tasks completed) - Cross-cutting improvements and validation

Created complete Docusaurus documentation site with:
- Configuration files (updated sidebars.js)
- Module overview page
- Three comprehensive chapters covering Gazebo physics simulation, Unity digital environments, and sensor simulation
- All content includes learning objectives, examples, exercises, and references

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete educational module for digital twin concepts
- 🧪 Tests: All content reviewed and validated against success criteria
- 📁 Files: 4 documentation files and 2 configuration files updated
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for deployment and further module development
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation successfully delivered all specified user stories

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All tasks completed successfully
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Deploy site and begin Module 3 development

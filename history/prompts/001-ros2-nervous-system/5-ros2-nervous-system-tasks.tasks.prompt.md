## Prompt

[No specific prompt provided - generating tasks based on design documents]

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive task list for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2). The tasks include:
- Phase 1: Setup tasks for Docusaurus initialization
- Phase 2: Foundational tasks for documentation infrastructure
- Phase 3: User Story 1 tasks for ROS 2 architecture content (P1 priority)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 tasks for Python AI agents content (P2 priority)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 tasks for URDF representation content (P3 priority)
- Phase 6: Polish and cross-cutting concerns
- Dependencies and execution order defined
- Parallel execution opportunities identified
- Implementation strategy for MVP and incremental delivery

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown for ROS 2 educational module
- 🧪 Tests: Tasks organized by user story for independent testing
- 📁 Files: tasks.md created with 40 specific tasks across 6 phases
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementation of tasks starting with setup phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks follow checklist format and enable parallel development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All tasks follow required format
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Start with T001 (Docusaurus initialization)
